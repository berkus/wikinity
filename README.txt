Final aim is to create a program that uses something like Flare/Prefuse to draw
a nice bubbly interface for wiki pages. So when I search for "wumpus", it gives
the "Hunt the Wumpus" page as the first, major, bubble, with a snippet of the
introductory text and perhaps a thumbnail of the first picture in the article.
This bubble shall be connected to other bubbles which pop into existence around
it, as the page gets parsed - links to other articles appear, and there shall be
links to different colour bubbles representing page categories
(1972 video games | Mainframe games | DOS games | TI-99/4A games | 
History of video games | Video games with textual graphics). Clicking on any
bubble will first make it bigger, showing more text, and it's possible to open
the full article in a separate window.
Key factor in the program must be a smooth flow of the visuals.

Key idea of the program: to see links between articles. Would be awesome if
it were possible to zoom out from one article, so that a larger network of
interconnected articles gets displayed.
